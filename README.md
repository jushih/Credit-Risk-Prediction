# Modeling Credit Risk with Decision Trees
The purpose of this project is to build a Decision Tree model that can predict credit worthiness. The model will be trained on the German Credit dataset available via the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)). The dataset contains 1,000 records and 62 features. One of the features describes the applicant's credit risk as either "Good" or "Bad". The other features are attributes related to the account or applicant, such as credit history, loan purpose, and employment duration. Because there is a surplus of attributes, feature selection will be performed to find the most optimal set of predictors.

Decision Trees are algorithms that split features into branching paths to arrive at a prediction. Decision Trees are suited to datasets with many features and may perform better than Linear or Logistic Regression models. 

This analysis will include:
* Data Preprocessing
* Building a Decision Tree Model with Hyperparameter Tuning
* Visualization of Decision Tree Model
* Feature Selection with Random Forest
* Advanced Decision Trees: Comparing Boosting-Based Algorithms
